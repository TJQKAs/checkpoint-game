Hot, Hot, Cold
=======================


## Description

Hot, Hot, Cold is a mobile geolocation game where the user is required to locate checkpoints from cues given and prompts as to whether they are getting 'hotter' or 'colder' based on their current location and the direction they are moving.

Other players' progress can also be monitored in real-time.

A checkpoint is located when a user arrives within 100m of it's given position and the winner is the first player to successfully locate each checkpoint.
